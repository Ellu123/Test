One very nice morning near the end of summer,
my mother woke me up at 4:00 A.M. and said, "Wake
up and smell the grass, sleepy head! Today is your
first day of school and you can't be late." I groaned in
my bed for twenty seconds, but eventually I got
dressed. I wore a blue and white striped, long sleeve
t shirt (noun) with a collar on it, a red tie,
dark gray pants, white socks, black shoes, and a(n)
pimp hat. In ten minutes I made
lunch and ate my breakfast. 67.75
minutes later, the bus came. A few minutes later, I
was at school.
In school, I met two really GAY  kids. All of us became
friends very fast. That day we had Science, and
luckily my friends and I were at the same
building .My friends' names are Adolf and Hitler. In Math we weren't
together, and that really bugged me. We learned what orgasms were, and when to use
them. At snack and recess, we played a game
together. It was extremely fun. At P. E., we were
fucking off of the ropes onto  a matress. I thought it was a very good idea. In swimming class,
we needed to swim extremely
gud, or else we would have to drown.
Before I knew it, school was over. I grabbed all
my belongings and put them into my backpack. In two
minutes, the bus came. As I stepped into the bus I
shouted, "Goodbye, adios amigos, and shalom," to
my friends. Then I went into the bus. In a flash, I was
back home. This day was an extremely exciting day!

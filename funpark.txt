Today, my fabulous camp group went to a (an)
faboulous (adjective) amusement park. It was a
fun park with lots of cool Nivalinnas (plural noun)
and enjoyable play structures. When we got there, my
kind counselor shouted loudly, "Everybody off the
nutsack (noun)." We all pushed out in a terrible
hurry. My counselor handed out yellow tickets, and
we scurried in. I was so excited! I couldn't figure out
what exciting thing to do first. I saw a scary roller
coaster I really liked so, I gracefully (adverb) ran
over to get in the long line that had about
8976456 (number) people in it. When I finally
got on the roller coaster I was _______  (past
tense verb). In fact I was so nervous my two knees
were knocking together. This was the wierdest
(-est adjective) ride I had ever been on! In about two
minutes I heard the crank and grinding of the gears.
Thatâ€™s when the ride began! When I got to the bottom,
I was a little ___whack a mole_________ (past tense verb) but I
was proud of myself. The rest of the day went
smoothly_ (adverb). It was a(n) fag 8=======3
(adjective) day at the fun park.
